	* Fix not to display a garbage when exec(2) fails.
2014-02-14  YASUOKA Masahiko
	* Revert the original way of handling of command and arguments
	  to be able to use a pipe.  It
	  uses "sh -c" to execute the command with the arguments,
	  therefore it requires doing "shell escape" at the arguments.
	* Introduce new -x option to avoid using "sh -c" in handling
	  command and arguments.  With this option, doing "shell escape"
	  is not necessary because command and arguments will pass to
	  exec(2) as it is.
